> An Application that will show you up to 10 random books if you enter a subject, e.g. "Love".

With this small project I learned how to use Redux with React and how to use data with it. I am using the Open Library API to get the data. Styled-Components is used for the styling.

### ‚ú® Check out the [Demo](https://random-book.netlify.app/)

## Improvements

Small Improvements could be made such as adding more stylish cards, for example with Material UI.\
A feature that could be implemented would be a reading list, in which you can add books to it and when you are done, create a pdf to save it.

## Install

After cloning the project you can use yarn to run the following scripts:

```sh
yarn
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn run start
```

```sh
yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
